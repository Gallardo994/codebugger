# Codebugger
Shortcoded replacement for MTA's internal debugger

# Why?
I made it in order to see the amount of errors and warnings instead of seeing the same line spam the debug console all the time

# Installation
1. Get it onto your server as a resource
2. Make sure your account has access to /debug command
3. Start the resource and do /debug

# TODO List
1. Add unique interface for errors and warnings
2. Fix many other things which I don't like at the moment
